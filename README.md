## üìñ Description
SharedMemorySample features two WinForms applications that exchange an image across processes. It uses a named MemoryMappedFile and a named AutoReset event to facilitate this exchange. The image data is processed with OpenCvSharp and displayed in PictureBox controls. This project demonstrates an efficient way to share data between Windows applications.
